### Overview

BetterCooldownManager extends Blizzard’s Edit Mode instead of replacing it. The goal is simple: keep everything fully compatible with the base UI while adding the tools Blizzard hasn't developed yet.

## Core Features

* Toggle Edit Mode directly.
* Open Advanced Settings.
* Icon Zoom control.
* Global Font Settings (Font, Size, Flags, Shadows).
* Custom Cooldown Text Settings: Font, Colour, Size, Anchor, Offset.
* Primary & Secondary Power Colour customization.

## Additional Modules

* Player Cast Bar
* Player Primary Power Bar
* Player Secondary Power Bar
* Defensive Cooldown Viewer

## Cooldown Viewers

All Viewers share the same settings, meaning you have full control on what you want your Cooldown Viewers to look like.

### Anchoring

* Utility, Buffs, and Defensive Viewers can anchor to a broad selection of frames.
* Add custom anchors manually or pick from predefined frames with the **Parent Selector**.

### Positioning & Layout

* Pixel-Perfect X/Y offsets.
* Icon Height & Width.

### Charges / Stacks

* Custom Anchors.
* Custom Colours.
* Custom Size & Offset.

## Defensive Cooldown Viewer

It creates a dedicated container that tracks defensive abilities automatically based on your class and specialization.

### Highlights

* Same customization as the other Cooldown Viewers.
* Predefined Defensive List for each Class & Specialization.
